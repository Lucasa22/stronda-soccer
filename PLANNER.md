# Stronda Soccer Development Planner

This document serves as the central planning and tracking tool for the Stronda Soccer development team. It outlines current tasks, progress, and future objectives.

## Current Sprint / Focus:

### Task: Verify Scene Functionality

*   **Description:** Systematically check each scene (`.tscn` file) to ensure it loads correctly, all nodes are properly referenced, and basic functionality (e.g., player movement, ball physics, UI elements) is working as expected.
*   **Status:** Awaiting User Verification
*   **Assigned To:** User (for manual testing), Orchestrator (for coordination), Developer (for fixes), Tester (for re-verification).
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Notes:**
    *   Focus on `scenes/game/Game3D.tscn` and `scenes/game/TrainingMode3D.tscn` first, as these are core gameplay scenes.
    *   Ensure all script references (`.gd` files) are valid and loaded.
    *   Check for any console errors or warnings during scene loading and runtime.
    *   **ACTION REQUIRED:** User to run the project in Godot Engine and report findings.

## Backlog / Future Tasks:

*   Implement comprehensive unit tests for core game logic.
*   Refactor player input handling for better modularity.
*   Integrate network multiplayer features.
*   Develop new AI behaviors for opponents.

## Agent Communication Log (Orchestrator Updates Only):

*   **[2025-07-07] Orchestrator:** Initialized `PLANNER.md` and `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. Ready to begin scene verification task.
*   **[2025-07-07] Orchestrator:** Updated `Game3D.tscn` and `TrainingMode3D.tscn` to use `camera_controller_simple.gd`.
